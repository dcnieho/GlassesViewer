function [fc, df] = savitzkyGolay(x,n,dn,x0,W,flag)
% Function:
%       Savitzky-Golay Smoothing and Differentiation Filter
%       The Savitzky-Golay smoothing/differentiation filter (i.e., the
%       polynomial smoothing/differentiation filter, or  the least-squares
%       smoothing/differentiation filters) optimally fit a set of data
%       points to polynomials of different degrees.
%       See for details in Matlab Documents (help sgolay). The sgolay
%       function in Matlab can deal with only symmetrical and uniformly
%       spaced data of even number.
%       This function presented here is a general implement of the sgolay
%       function in Matlab. The Savitzky-Golay filter coefficients for even
%       number, nonsymmetrical and nonuniformly spaced data can be
%       obtained. And the filter coefficients for the initial point or the
%       end point can be obtained too. In addition, either numerical
%       results or symbolical results can be obtained. Lastly, this
%       function is faster than MATLAB's sgolay.
%       Another difference with the matlab implementation is that to
%       retrieve estimates of the P-th order derivative, one does need to
%       multiply the filter output by P!. The filter coefficients returned
%       in the fc output include this scaling already. Note that the
%       differentiation filters returned in df do need such scaling.
%
% Usage:
%       [fc,df] = savitzkyGolay(x,n,dn,x0,flag)
%   input:
%       x    = the original data point, e.g., -5:5
%       n    = polynomial order
%       dn   = differentation order (0=smoothing),  default=0
%       x0   = estimation point, can be a vector    default=0
%       W    = weight vector, can be empty
%              must have same length as x0          default=identity
%       flag = numerical(0) or symbolical(1),
%              symbolical gives you the exact
%              solution which you can cast to
%              numbers                              default=0
%
%   output:
%       fc   = filter coefficients obtained (B output of sgolay).
%       df   = differentiation filters (G output of sgolay).
% Notes:
% 1.    x can be arbitrary, e.g., odd number or even number, symmetrical or
%       nonsymmetrical, uniformly spaced or nonuniformly spaced, etc.
% 2.    x0 can be arbitrary, e.g., the initial point, the end point, etc.
% 3.    Either numerical results or symbolical results can be obtained.
% Example:
%       savitzkyGolay([-3:3],2,0,0,[],0)
%       savitzkyGolay([-3:3],2,0,0,[],1)
%       savitzkyGolay([-3:3],2,0,-3,[],1)
%       savitzkyGolay([-3:3],2,1,2,[],1)
%       savitzkyGolay([-2:3],2,1,1/2,[],1)
%       savitzkyGolay([-5:2:5],2,1,0,[],1)
%       savitzkyGolay([-1:1 2:2:8],2,0,0,[],1)

%       http://www.mathworks.in/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4038-savitzky-golay-smoothing-and-differentiation-filter
%       Allthough I have replaced almost all the code (partially based on
%       the comments on the FEX submission), increasing its compatibility
%       with MATLABs sgolay (now supports a weight matrix), its numerical
%       stability and it speed. Now, the help is pretty much all that
%       remains.
