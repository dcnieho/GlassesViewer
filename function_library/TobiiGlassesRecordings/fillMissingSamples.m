% NB!! we have data for each eye and binocular for matched gidx (gidx by
% now removed from data as no longer needed). Data for same gidx doesn't
% however always come with exactly the same timestamps. As differences are
% (should be) tiny, we can ignore this. There is a check yielding a warning
% for this at the end of this function.

% fill gaps with nans (just split time interval between two samples
% into equally sized bits). You may think we can do this based on gidx.
% every non-existent gidx just needs a ts (or better yet, just keep those
% ts). Can't do that as the gidx are a bit messy. there are some spurious
% ones in there with non-zero s (crap). And there are genuine gaps in the
% data where gidx doesn't increase. So best we can do is just look at the
% data and go from there. I see there are some very few samples where
% there is e.g. 13 ms between samples instead of 10. we'll just have to
% live with that

% gaps are places where ISI is 1.333 (4/3) times longer than expected given
% sampling frequency expectedFs (arbitrarily chosen). Plug 'em, filling the
% signals up with nan data
