instead of fake time, use ts of gidx that are all missing but have 8 packets, where possible. for demo recording, we now have the problem that gaze stream is too short as missing at start and end of file is ignored/removed
read-in strategy might be to test per gidx whether packets are screwed or not, and only then check for missing data, keeping timestamps around anyway
use a screenshot from screenshots folder for readme
move textCodingFile to demo_recording as exampleCodingFile, put better content in it (e.g., handcode first three seconds myself)
